AI Knowledge Assistant is an intelligent system based on the RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generation) architecture that allows users to ask natural language questions and receive accurate, context-aware answers sourced from their own documents and knowledge base. The project is designed as a learning and research initiative to master the full development cycle of modern AI-powered applications and key tools in the LLMOps ecosystem.
